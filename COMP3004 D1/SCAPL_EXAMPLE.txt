dci a #declares integer a
rdi a #asks user for value and stores it in variable a
dci b #declares integer b
rdi b #asks user for value and stores it in variable a
L1: rdi a #asks user for value and stores it in variable a if L1 is called
cmp a b #compares the two entered variables
jmr L1 #keeps looping through asking one user for a different number until it matches the first one
jmp L2 #jumps to L2
L2: end #ends the game
# put in a and get a friend to put in b. If you guess a to be the same as b you win!
